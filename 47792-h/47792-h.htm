<h2><a name="Alcestis" id="Alcestis"></a>Alcestis.</h2>

<p class="pagenum"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span></p>

<p class="intro">How Admetus was saved from the disagreeable necessity of
dying by his wife Alcestis, who was permitted to die in his stead,
and how Heracles, in gratitude for Admetus&rsquo; hospitality, wrestled
with Death for her and restored her to her husband, has been
narrated by Euripides. What Euripides did not do was to give
us any hint of the subsequent history of the reunited couple.
Did they live happily ever afterwards, or&mdash;&mdash;? But the
sequel must show. It is written in the woman-hating vein so
often seen in Euripides, and its title has been Latinized for the
benefit of those who have forgotten their Greek.</p>

<h2><a name="Hamlet" id="Hamlet"></a>Hamlet.</h2>

<p class="pagenum"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span></p>

<p class="intro">Among the plays which seem specially to require a sequel,
&ldquo;Hamlet&rdquo; must certainly be reckoned. The end of Act V. left the
distracted kingdom of Denmark bereft alike of King, Queen,
and Heir-Presumptive. There were thus all the materials for
an acute political crisis. It might have been imagined that the
crown would fall inevitably to the Norwegian Prince Fortinbras
who, being on the spot with an army behind him, certainly seems
to have neglected his chances. It is clear, however, from the
sequel that Fortinbras failed to rise to the occasion, and that
Horatio, being more an antique Roman than a Dane, seized his
opportunity and by a <span style="font-style:normal;">coup d&rsquo;état</span> got possession of the vacant
throne. Nor would Fortinbras appear to have resented this, as
we find him subsequently visiting Horatio at Elsinore. There
is, however, a Nemesis which waits upon Usurpers, as the
sequel shows. The sequel, by the way, should have been called
&ldquo;Ghosts,&rdquo; but that title has been already appropriated by a lesser
dramatist.</p>

<p class="intro">The end of &ldquo;Much Ado about Nothing&rdquo; must always leave
the sympathetic playgoer in tears. The future looks black for
everybody concerned. Claudio&rsquo;s jealous disposition will make
him a most uncomfortable husband for the resuscitated Hero,
while Benedick and Beatrice are likely to find that a common
taste in badinage is not the most satisfactory basis for matrimony.
When it is added that Don John&rsquo;s genius for plotting
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>is sure in the end to get him into trouble one feels that nothing
can be gloomier than the prospects of the entire cast.</p>

<span class="character">Beatrice</span> is beside him, keeping up her reputation for
conversational brilliancy by a series of sprightly witticisms.</p>

<p class="character">Beatrice.</p>

<p class="speech">Very likely I do talk twice as much as I should. But
then, if I talk too much you certainly listen far too little,
so we are quits. Do you hear?</p>

<p class="speech">[<span class="direction">Opening his eyes slowly.</span>] Eh?</p>

<p class="character">Beatrice.</p>

<p class="speech">I believe you were asleep! But there&mdash;&rsquo;tis a great
compliment to my wit. Like Orpheus, I can put even
the savage beasts to sleep with it. [<span class="direction"><span class="character">Benedick&rsquo;s</span> eyes close
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>again, and he appears to sink into a profound doze.</span>] But if
the beasts go to sleep there&rsquo;s no use in being witty. I
suppose Orpheus never thought of that. Come, wake
up, good Signior Beast. [<span class="direction">Prods him coquettishly with her

<p class="speech">[<span class="direction">Impressively.</span>] My dear Lord, never marry a witty
wife! If you do, you&rsquo;ll repent it. But it&rsquo;s a painful

<p class="character">Don Pedro.</p>

<p class="speech">[<span class="direction">Coughing nervously.</span>] Well, the truth is, Claudio&rsquo;s
marriage hasn&rsquo;t been exactly one of my successes. You
remember I made <em>that</em> match too?</p>

<p class="character">Benedick.</p>

<p class="speech">I remember. Don&rsquo;t they hit it off?</p>

<p class="character">Don Pedro.</p>

<p class="speech">[<span class="direction">Querulously.</span>] It was all Claudio&rsquo;s suspicious temper.
He never would disabuse his mind of the idea that Hero
was making love to somebody else. You remember he
began that even before he was married. First it was <em>me</em>
he suspected. Then it was the mysterious man under
her balcony.</p>

<p class="character">Benedick.</p>

<p class="speech">You suspected him too.</p>

<p class="character">Don Pedro.</p>

<p class="speech">That&rsquo;s true. But that was all my brother John&rsquo;s fault.
Anyhow, I thought when they were once married things
would settle down comfortably.</p>

<p class="pagenum"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span></p>

<p class="character">Benedick.</p>

<p class="speech">You were curiously sanguine. I should have thought
anyone would have seen that after that scene in the
church they would never be happy together.</p>

<p class="character">Don Pedro.</p>

<p class="speech">Perhaps so. Anyhow, they weren&rsquo;t. Of course,
everything was against them. What with my brother
John&rsquo;s absolute genius for hatching plots, and my utter
inability to detect them, not to speak of Claudio&rsquo;s unfortunate
propensity for overhearing conversations and
misunderstanding them, the intervals of harmony
between them were extremely few, and, at last, Hero
lost patience and divorced him.</p>

<p class="character">Benedick.</p>

<p class="speech">So bad as that? How did it happen?</p>

<p class="character">Don Pedro.</p>

<p class="speech">Oh, in the old way. My brother pretended that Hero
was unfaithful, and as he could produce no evidence of
the fact whatever, of course Claudio believed him. So,
with his old passion for making scenes, he selected the
moment when I and half-a-dozen others were staying at
the house and denounced her before us all after dinner.</p>

<p class="character">Benedick.</p>

<p class="speech">The church scene over again?</p>

<p class="pagenum"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span></p>

<p class="character">Don Pedro.</p>

<p class="speech">No. It took place in the drawing-room. Hero behaved
with her usual dignity, declined to discuss Claudio&rsquo;s
accusations altogether, put the matter in the hands of her
solicitor, and the decree was made absolute last week.</p>

<p class="character">Benedick.</p>

<p class="speech">She was perfectly innocent, of course?</p>

<p class="character">Don Pedro.</p>

<p class="speech">Completely. It was merely another <em>ruse</em> on the part
of my amiable brother. Really, John&rsquo;s behaviour was
inexcusable.</p>

<p class="character">Benedick.</p>

<p class="speech">Was Claudio greatly distressed when he found how he
had been deceived?</p>

<p class="character">Don Pedro.</p>

<p class="speech">He was distracted. But Hero declined to have anything
more to do with him. She said she could forgive
a man for making a fool of himself once, but twice was
too much of a good thing.</p>

<p class="character">Benedick.</p>

<p class="speech">[<span class="direction">Frowning.</span>] That so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>unds rather more epigrammatic
than a really <em>nice</em> wife&rsquo;s remarks should be.</p>

<p class="character">Don Pedro.</p>

<p class="speech">She had great provocation.</p>

<p class="character">Benedick.</p>

<p class="speech">That&rsquo;s true. And one can see her point of view. It
was the publicity of the thing that galled her, no doubt.
But poor Claudio had no reticence whatever. That
scene in the church was in the worst possible taste. But
I forgot. <em>You</em> had a share in that.</p>

<p class="character">Don Pedro.</p>

<p class="speech">[<span class="direction">Stiffly.</span>] I don&rsquo;t think we need go into that question.</p>

<p class="character">Benedick.</p>

<p class="speech">And now to select the hour, after a dinner party, for
taxing his wife with infidelity! How like Claudio!
Really, he must be an absolute fool.</p>

<p class="character">Don Pedro.</p>

<p class="speech">Oh, well, <em>your</em> marriage doesn&rsquo;t seem to have been a
conspicuous success, if you come to that.</p>

<p class="character">Benedick.</p>

<p class="speech">[<span class="direction">Savagely.</span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>] That&rsquo;s no great credit to you, is it? <em>You</em>
made the match. You said as much a moment ago.</p>

<p class="character">Don Pedro.</p>

<p class="speech">I know, I know. But seriously, my dear Benedick,
what is wrong?</p>

<p class="character">Benedick.</p>

<p class="speech">[<span class="direction">Snappishly.</span>] Beatrice, of course. You don&rsquo;t suppose
<em>I&rsquo;m</em> wrong, do you?</p>

<p class="character">Don Pedro.</p>

<p class="speech">Come, that&rsquo;s better. A spark of the old Benedick.
Let me call your wife to you, and we&rsquo;ll have one of your
old encounters of wit.</p>

<p class="character">Benedick.</p>

<p class="speech">[<span class="direction">Seriously alarmed.</span>] For Heaven&rsquo;s sake, no. Ah, my
dear Lord, if you only knew how weary I am of wit,
especially Beatrice&rsquo;s wit.</p>

<p class="character">Don Pedro.</p>

<p class="speech">You surprise me. I remember I thought her a most
amusing young lady.</p>

<p class="character">Benedick.</p>

<p class="speech">[<span class="direction">Tersely.</span>] You weren&rsquo;t married to her.</p>

<p class="character">Don Pedro.</p>

<p class="speech">But what is it you complain of?</p>

<p class="pagenum"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span></p>

<p class="character">Benedick.</p>

<p class="speech">Beatrice <em>bores me</em>. It is all very well to listen to
sparkling sallies for ten minutes or so, but Beatrice
sparkles for hours together. She is utterly incapable
of answering the simplest question without a blaze of
epigram. When I ask her what time it is, she becomes
so insufferably facetious that all the clocks stop in disgust.
And once when I was thoughtless enough to enquire what
there was for dinner, she made so many jokes on the
subject that I had to go down without her. And even
then the soup was cold!</p>

<p class="character">Don Pedro.</p>

<p class="speech">[<span class="direction">Quoting.</span>] &ldquo;Here you may see Benedick, the married
man!&rdquo;</p>

<p class="character">Benedick.</p>

<p class="speech">Don&rsquo;t <em>you</em> try to be funny too! One joker in a
household is quite enough, I can tell you. And poor
Beatrice&rsquo;s jokes aren&rsquo;t always in the best of taste either.
The other day, when the Vicar came to lunch he was so
shocked at her that he left before the meal was half over
and his wife has never called since.</p>

<p class="pagenum"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span></p>

<p class="character">Don Pedro.</p>

<p class="speech">My poor Benedick, I wish I could advise you. But I
really don&rsquo;t know what to suggest. My brother could
have helped you, I&rsquo;m sure. He was always so good at
intrigue. But unfortunately I had him executed after
his last exploit with Claudio. It&rsquo;s most unlucky. But
that&rsquo;s the worst of making away with a villain. You
never know when you may need him. Poor John could
always be depended upon in an emergency of this kind.</p>

<p class="character">Benedick.</p>

<p class="speech">[<span class="direction">Gloomily.</span>] He is certainly a great loss.</p>

<p class="character">Don Pedro.</p>

<p class="speech">Don&rsquo;t you think you could arrange so that Beatrice
should overhear you making love to someone else?
We&rsquo;ve tried that sort of thing more than once in this play.</p>

<p class="character">Benedick.</p>

<p class="speech">[<span class="direction">Acidly.</span>] As the result has invariably been disastrous,
I think we may dismiss that expedient from our minds.
No, there&rsquo;s nothing for it but to put up with the infliction,
and by practising a habit of mental abstraction, reduce
the evil to within bearable limits.</p>

<p class="character">Don Pedro.</p>

<p class="speech">I don&rsquo;t think I quite follow you.</p>

<p class="pagenum"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span></p>

<p class="character">Benedick.</p>

<p class="speech">In plain English, my dear Lord, I find the only way
to go on living with Beatrice is never to listen to her.
As soon as she begins to be witty I fall into a kind of
swoon, and in that comatose condition I can live through
perfect coruscations of brilliancy without inconvenience.</p>

<p class="character">Don Pedro.</p>

<p class="speech">Does she like that?</p>

<p class="character">Benedick.</p>

<p class="speech">Candidly, I don&rsquo;t think she does.</p>

<p class="character">Don Pedro.</p>

<p class="speech">Hold! I have an idea.</p>

<p class="character">Benedick.</p>

<p class="speech">[<span class="direction">Nervously.</span>] I hope not. Your ideas have been
singularly unfortunate hitherto in my affairs.</p>

<p class="character">Don Pedro.</p>

<p class="speech">Ah, but you&rsquo;ll approve of this.</p>

<p class="character">Benedick.</p>

the <i>néant géant</i>. The theory of the author of <i>The Spanish

<p class="speech">As you will. [<span class="direction">Selecting a new cutting.</span>] &ldquo;In his new
play <i>The Spanish Armada</i> Mr. Puff has set himself to
deal with one of those problems of feminine psychology
with which Ibsen, Hauptmann, and Sudermann, and all
the newer school of continental dramatists have made us
familiar. The problem is briefly this. When filial duty
beckons a woman one way and passion another, which
call should she obey? Should she set herself to &lsquo;live
her life,&rsquo; in the modern phrase, to realise her individuality
and stand forth glad and free as Gregers Werle says?
Or should she deny her <i>ego</i>, bow to the old conventions,
accept the old Shibboleths and surrender her
love? Like <i>Nora</i>, like <i>Hedda</i>, <i>Tilburina</i> is a personality
at war with its environment....&rdquo;</p>

the critics were all unfavourable to Mr. Puff&rsquo;s play?</p>

Yes, Madam, six months ago, when I found you concealed
behind a screen in Mr. Surface&rsquo;s library, you promised
that if I would forgive you your future conduct should
prove the sincerity of your repentance. I forgave you,
Madam, and this is my reward!</p>

nature of my attentions and I, knowing her temper [<span class="direction">bowing
to <span class="character">Lady Teazle</span></span>], feared to undeceive her lest she
should use her influence to prejudice me in the eyes of
your ward. That, Sir Peter, is the true explanation of
the situation in which you found Lady Teazle on that
unlucky morning.</p>

<p class="character">Lady Teazle.</p>

<p class="speech">[<span class="direction">With suppressed fury.</span>] Pray Sir Peter, do you propose
to continue to permit this gentleman to speak of me in
this way?</p>

<p class="character">Sir Peter.</p>

<p class="speech">Certainly, Madam. Everything that Mr. Surface has
said seems to me to bear the stamp of truth.</p>

<p class="speech">Ah!</p>

<p class="character">Joseph.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span></p>

<p class="speech">So, you see, Sir Peter, you never had any real cause of
jealousy towards me. My conduct was foolish, I admit,
but it was never criminal.</p>

<p class="character">Sir Peter.</p>

<p class="speech">Joseph, I believe you. Give me your hand. Six
months ago I thought you guilty of the basest treachery
towards me. But a year of marriage with Lady Teazle
has convinced me that, in her relations with you as in
her relations with me, it is always Lady Teazle who is
in the wrong.</p>

<p class="direction right">[<span class="direction">They shake hands warmly.</span></p>

<p class="character">Lady Teazle.</p>

<p class="speech">I will not stay here to be insulted in this manner. I
will go straight to Lady Sneerwell&rsquo;s, and tear both your
characters to tatters.</p>

<p class="speech">What, <em>you</em> say that! My dear Joseph, this is indeed a
reformation. Had it been Charles now, I should not
have been surprised.</p>

<p class="character">Joseph.</p>

<p class="speech">Egad, Sir Peter, in the matter of sentiments Charles,
for a long time, had a most unfair advantage of me. For,
having no character to lose, he had no need of sentiments
to support it. But now I have as little character as he,
and we start fair. Now I am a free man; I say what I
think, do what I please. Scandal has done its worst with
me, and I no longer fear it. Whereas, when I had a
character for morality to maintain, all my time was
wasted in trying to live up to it. I had to conceal every
trifling flirtation, and had finally wrapped myself in such
a web of falsehood that when your hand tore away the
veil, I give you my word, I was almost grateful. Depend
upon it, Sir Peter, there&rsquo;s no possession in the world so
troublesome as a good reputation.</p>

<p class="speech">No, no, Joseph. Stay, and hear what I have to tell

[<span class="direction"><span class="character">Joseph</span> laughs heartily.</span>] Zounds, Nephew, don&rsquo;t stand
chuckling there. And his character has not reformed
one whit, in spite of his promises. His flirtations with
my Lady Sneerwell and others are so excessive that
Maria has quite thrown him over, and the engagement
is broken off. Add to this that I have paid his debts
three times, only to find him contracting fresh liabilities,
and you may judge that my patience is exhausted.</p>

<p class="character">Joseph.</p>

<p class="speech">But these are old stories, Uncle. You knew that
Charles was vicious and extravagant when you made
him your heir. He has done nothing fresh to offend
you.</p>

<p class="character">Sir Oliver.</p>

<p class="speech">On the contrary. He has done something which has
hurt me deeply.</p>

<p class="character">Joseph.</p>

dependent wholly on your bounty!</p>

<p class="character">Sir Oliver.</p>

<p class="speech">Wait till you have <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>heard the whole story. A week
ago your brother came to me for money to meet some
gambling debt. I refused him. Whereupon, he
returned to his house, had in an auctioneer and sold
everything that it contained.</p>

<p class="character">Joseph.</p>

<p class="speech">[<span class="direction">Much amused.</span>] And did you play little Premium a
second time, Uncle?</p>

<p class="character">Sir Oliver.</p>

<p class="speech">[<span class="direction">Testily.</span>] Certainly not, Sir. On this occasion I left
the rogue to settle matters for himself.</p>

<p class="character">Joseph.</p>

<p class="speech">But I see no great harm in this. Why should not
Charles sell his furniture?</p>

<p class="intro">Many people must have wondered whether happiness resulted
from the marriage between Charles Marlow, whose shyness with
ladies, it will be remembered, prevented his ever having a word
to say to any woman above the rank of a barmaid, and the
vivacious Kate Hardcastle. The following sequel reveals the
painful truth.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<h3>STILL STOOPING.</h3>

<p class="scene"><span class="smcap">Scene I.</span>&mdash;The parlour of <span class="character">Charles Marlow&rsquo;s</span> house. He
and <span class="character">Kate</span> are sitting on opposite sides of the fire. Silence
reigns, and <span class="character">Charles</span> fidgets nervously.</p>

<p class="character">Kate.</p>

<p class="speech">[<span class="direction">Anticipating a remark subsequently made by <span class="character">Paula
Tanqueray</span>.</span>] Six minutes!</p>

<p class="character">Charles.</p>

<p class="speech">[<span class="direction">Finding his tongue with an effort.</span>] Er&mdash;eh?</p>

<p class="character">Kate.</p>

<p class="speech">Exactly six minutes, dear, since you made your last
remark.</p>

<p class="pagenum"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span></p>

<p class="character">Charles.</p>

<p class="speech">[<span class="direction">Laughing uneasily and blushing.</span>] Um&mdash;ah!&mdash;ha! ha.</p>

<p class="character">Kate.</p>

<p class="speech">Well? What are you going to say next? It&rsquo;s really
time you made an observation of some kind, you know.</p>

<p class="character">Charles.</p>

<p class="speech">[<span class="direction">Helplessly.</span>] Um&mdash;er&mdash;I&rsquo;ve nothing to say.</p>

<p class="character">Kate.</p>

<p class="speech">[<span class="direction">Rallying him.</span>] Come, make an effort.</p>

<p class="character">Charles.</p>

<p class="speech">[<span class="direction">In desperation.</span>] It&rsquo;s&mdash;er&mdash;a fine day.</p>

<p class="character">Kate.</p>

<p class="speech">[<span class="direction">Genially.</span>] Considering that it&rsquo;s raining steadily,
dear, and has been for the past half-hour, I hardly think
that can be considered a fortunate opening.</p>

<p class="character">Charles.</p>

<p class="speech">[<span class="direction">Covered with confusion.</span>] Confound it! so it is.
Forgive me&mdash;er&mdash;my dear, I didn&rsquo;t know what I was
saying.</p>

<p class="character">Charles.</p>

<p class="speech">What a fool you must think me!</p>

<p class="character">Kate.</p>

<p class="speech">[<span class="direction">Touched by his evident sincerity.</span>] Never mind. It&rsquo;s a
shame to laugh at you. But you <em>are</em> rather absurd, you
know. [<span class="direction">She goes over and kisses him. He accepts the caress

<p class="character">Charles.</p>

<p class="speech">I know, my love. But I&rsquo;ve always been shy like that.
It&rsquo;s an idiosyncrasy.</p>

<p class="character">Kate.</p>

<p class="speech">Not idiosyncrasy, dear. Idiocy. The words are so
much alike.</p>

<p class="character">Charles.</p>

<p class="speech">[<span class="direction">Hurt.</span>] Ah, now you&rsquo;re laughing at me!</p>

<p class="character">Kate.</p>

<p class="speech">Of course I am, goose. [<span class="direction">Argumentatively.</span>] You see,
dear, as long as you were a bachelor it was all very well
to be bashful. But now that we are married, I really
think you ought to fight against it!</p>

<p class="character">Charles.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span></p>

<p class="speech">Fight against it! I fight against it every hour of the
day. Every morning I say to myself, &ldquo;I really must
get over this ridiculous shyness. I must try and show
Kate how much I&mdash;er&mdash;love her.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="character">Kate.</p>

<p class="speech">You are curiously unsuccessful, dear.</p>

<p class="character">Charles.</p>

<p class="speech">[<span class="direction">Miserably.</span>] I feel that. But it&rsquo;s not for lack of
trying. [<span class="direction">Desperately.</span>] Do you suppose, Kate, that
anything but the strongest effort of will keeps me
sitting in this chair at this moment? Do I ever, save
under compulsion, remain in the same room with <em>any</em>
lady for more than five minutes? Why, my dear girl,
if I didn&rsquo;t love you to distraction, I shouldn&rsquo;t remain
here an instant!</p>

<p class="character">Kate.</p>

<p class="speech">You certainly have a curious method of displaying an
ardent attachment.</p>

<p class="character">Charles.</p>

<p class="speech">Yes. It&rsquo;s most unfortunate. But I warned you, dear,
didn&rsquo;t I? I told you all about my absurd bashfulness
before we became engaged. You knew that the presence
of ladies invariably reduced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span> me to speechlessness before
you accepted me.</p>

<p class="character">Kate.</p>

<p class="speech">[<span class="direction">Sweetly.</span>] Not <em>invariably</em>, my love. What about
your prowess with Mrs. Mantrap and Lady Betty
Blackleg that you told me about? [<span class="direction"><span class="character">Charles</span> blushes
crimson.</span>] Didn&rsquo;t they call you &ldquo;their agreeable Rattle&rdquo;
at the Ladies&rsquo; Club in Town?</p>

<p class="character">Charles.</p>

<p class="speech">I&mdash;er&mdash;get on well enough with&mdash;um&mdash;er disreputable
ladies. But you&mdash;er&mdash;aren&rsquo;t disreputable.</p>

<p class="character">Kate.</p>

<p class="speech">You are too modest, dear. Some of your conquests
are <em>quite</em> respectable. Didn&rsquo;t I come upon you in the act
of kissing Anne, the housemaid, yesterday? And no one
can pretend that <em>my</em> housemaids are disreputable!</p>

<p class="character">Charles.</p>

<p class="speech">[<span class="direction">Sighing.</span>] Yes. I&rsquo;m not shy with housemaids.</p>

<p class="character">Kate.</p>

<p class="speech">So I noticed. I sent Anne away this morning.</p>

<p class="character">Charles.</p>

<p class="speech">[<span class="direction">With real concern.</span>] Not Anne!</p>

<p class="pagenum"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span></p>

<p class="character">Kate.</p>

<p class="speech">Yes. And Sarah too. I thought I detected in you a
lurking <i>penchant</i> for Sarah.</p>

<p class="character">Charles.</p>

<p class="speech">[<span class="direction">Simply.</span>] Yes, I liked Sarah.</p>

<p class="character">Kate.</p>

<p class="speech">So now we haven&rsquo;t a single maid in the house. It&rsquo;s
really very inconvenient.</p>

<p class="character">Charles.</p>

<p class="speech">You must get others.</p>

<p class="character">Kate.</p>

<p class="speech">For you to make eyes at? Certainly not. By the
way, is there <em>any</em> type of female domestic servant whom
you do not find irresistibly attractive? Dark ones?
Fair ones? Young ones? Old ones? Tall ones?
Short ones? [<span class="direction">He shakes his head at each question.</span>] Not
one?</p>

<p class="character">Charles.</p>

<p class="speech">I&rsquo;m afraid not.</p>

<p class="character">Kate.</p>
<p class="pagenum"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span></p>
<p class="speech">[<span class="direction">With decision.</span>] Then I must do the house-work
myself.</p>

<p class="character">Charles.</p>

<p class="speech">[<span class="direction">Delighted.</span>] Charming! My dear Kate, how
delightful! Put on a cap and apron and take a
broom in your hand, and my bashfulness will vanish
at once. I know it will.</p>

<p class="character">Kate.</p>

<p class="speech">It seems the only course open to us, especially as
there&rsquo;s no one else to sweep the rooms. But I wish you
were not so unfortunately constituted.</p>

<p class="character">Charles.</p>

<p class="speech">[<span class="direction">Heartily.</span>] So do I. But, after all, we must accept
facts and make the best of them. You stooped to
conquer, you know. You must go on stooping. Go
and put on an apron at once.</p>

time?</p>

<p class="character">Charles.</p>

<p class="speech">It may, dear. But I think it would be unwise to
count upon it. No, as far as I can see, the only thing

<h2><a name="The_Lady_of_Lyons" id="The_Lady_of_Lyons"></a>The Lady of Lyons.</h2>

<p class="intro">When Lord Lytton provided the conve<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>ntional &ldquo;happy ending&rdquo;
for &ldquo;The Lady of Lyons&rdquo; by reuniting Pauline, née
Deschappelles, to the devoted Claude Melnotte, promoting the
latter to the rank of Colonel in the French army, he seems not
to have troubled his head as to the divergent social ideas of the
happy pair, nor as to how the vulgar and purse-proud family of
Deschappelles and the humbler Melnottes would get on together.
The sequel throws a lurid light on these points. In writing it,
great pains have been taken to make the blank verse, wherever
possible, as bad as Lord Lytton&rsquo;s.</p>

<h3>IN THE LYONS DEN.</h3>

<p class="scene"><span class="smcap">Scene.</span>&mdash;The drawing-room of <span class="character">Claude Melnotte&rsquo;s</span> house.
<span class="character">Pauline</span> is sitting by the fire, <span class="character">Claude</span> leaning with his

<p class="speech">My dear Claude, that woman! Mr. Smith kept a

money by his contracts to supply the armies of the

I am not going to give in to these unhealthy modern

James we are not at home to anyone except Mrs.

<p class="character">Claude.</p>

<p class="speech">Oh, no, don&rsquo;t do that. My mother will enjoy meeting
our friends.</p>

<p class="speech">No doubt, dear. But will our friends enjoy meeting
your mother? [<span class="direction">Seeing him about to burst forth again.</span>] Oh,
yes, Claude, I know what you are going to say. But,
after all, Lyons is a very purse-proud, vulgar place. You
know, how <em>my</em> mother can behave on occasions! And if
Mrs. Melnotte happens to be here when any other people
call it may be very unpleasant. I really think I had

I&rsquo;m afraid we shall never get into Society. It&rsquo;s very

<p class="character">Claude.</p>

<p class="speech">[<span class="direction">Touched by her patience.</span>] I am sorry, my dear. I

<p class="speech">[<span class="direction">Wilfully misunderstanding him.</span>] It&rsquo;s dreadfully snobbish,
dear; the most snobbish sort of Society I know.
All provincial towns are like that. But it&rsquo;s the only

<p class="intro">Most people, in their day, have wept tears of relief at the
ending of T. W. Robertson&rsquo;s comedy &ldquo;Caste,&rdquo; when the Hon.

his wife, Esther, while his father-in-law, Eccles, bestows a
drunken benediction upon him before starting for Jersey, and his
sister-in-law, Polly, and her adored plumber, Gerridge, embrace
sympathetically in the background. In these circumstances it
seems hardly kind to add a further act to this harrowing drama.
But the writer of Sequels, like Nemesis, is inexorable. If the
perusal of the following scene prevents any young subaltern from
emulating D&rsquo;Alroy and marrying a ballet-dancer with a drunken
father, it will not have been written in vain.</p>

<p class="speech">My dear Esther, Mr. Eccles made his hundred and
fifty-sixth appearance in the police-court last week. The
fact was made the subject of jocular comment in the

or seven days.</p>

<p class="character">Esther.</p>

<p class="character">George.</p>

<p class="speech">Not half so acutely as I did. I paid the five shillings.
If he had only consented to remain in Jersey!</p>

well there.</p>

<p class="character">George.</p>

<p class="speech">He was never sober there. That was the only thing
that was the matter with him. No, my love, let us look
facts in the face. You are a dear little woman, but your
father is detestable, and there is not the smallest ground
for hope that my mother will ever be &ldquo;reconciled&rdquo; to
our marriage as long as she retains her reason.</p>

<p class="character">Esther.</p>

<p class="speech">I suppose father <em>is</em> rather a difficulty.</p>

<p class="character">George.</p>

<p class="speech">Yes. He and the Gerridges, between them, have
made us impossible socially.</p>

<p class="character">Esther.</p>

<p class="speech">What&rsquo;s the matter with the Gerridges?</p>

<p class="character">George.</p>

<p class="speech">Nothing, except that you always ask them to all our
dinner parties. And as gentlepeople have a curious prejudice
against sitting down to dinner with a plumber and
glazier, it somewhat narrows our circle of acquaintance.</p>

<p class="character">Esther.</p>

<p class="speech">But Sam isn&rsquo;t a working plumber now. He has a
shop of his own&mdash;quite a large shop. And their house
is just as good as ours. The furniture i<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>s better. Sam
bought Polly a new carpet for the drawing-room only
last week. It cost fourteen pounds. And <em>our</em> drawing-room
carpet is dreadfully shabby.</p>

<p class="character">George.</p>

<p class="speech">I&rsquo;m glad they&rsquo;re getting on so well. [<span class="direction">With a flicker of
hope.</span>] Do you think there&rsquo;s any chance, as they grow
more prosperous, of their &ldquo;dropping&rdquo; us?</p>

little George.</p>

<p class="character">George.</p>

<p class="speech">Poor child, yes. He has played with their children
ever since he could toddle. And what is the result? A
Cockney accent that is indescribable.</p>

<p class="character">Esther.</p>

<p class="speech">What does it matter about his accent so long as he is
a good boy, and grows up to be a good man?</p>

<p class="character">George.</p>

<p class="speech">Ethically, my dear, not at all. But practically, it
matters a great deal. It causes me intense physical
discomfort. And I think it is killing my mother.</p>

<p class="character">Esther.</p>

<p class="speech">George!</p>

<p class="character">George.</p>

<p class="speech">Moreover, when the time comes for him to go to a
Public school he will probably be very unhappy in
consequence.</p>

<p class="character">Esther.</p>

<p class="speech">Why?</p>

<p class="character">George.</p>

<p class="speech">Merely irrational prejudice. Public school boys dislike
all deviations from the normal. And to them&mdash;happily&mdash;a
pronounced Cockney accent represents the height of
abnormality.</p>

<p class="character">Esther.</p>

<p class="speech">My dear, I love you to distraction. That&rsquo;s exactly the
difficulty. I am torn between my devotion to you and
my abhorrence of your relations. When your father
returned from Jersey, and took a lodging close by us,
nothing but the warmth of my affection prevented me
from leaving you for ever. He is still here, and so am I.
What greater proof could you have of the strength of my
attachment?</p>

<p class="character">Esther.</p>

<p class="intro">After the second<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span> Mrs. Tanqueray killed herself at the end of
the play which bears her name, it might be supposed that her
husband would be content with his two successive failures in
matrimony, and not tempt a third. But Aubrey, as his second
marriage shows, was nothing if not courageous in matrimonial
affairs, and we have therefore every reason to believe that he did
marry again, while we have small ground for hoping that he
chose his third wife with any greater wisdom than he chose the
other two. That is the impression conveyed by the following
pathetic scene.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<h3>THE THIRD MRS. TANQUERAY.</h3>

<p class="scene"><span class="smcap">Scene.</span>&mdash;The dining-room of <span class="character">Aubrey Tanqueray&rsquo;s</span> country
house, Highercombe, in Surrey. A lean butler is standing
at the sideboard. <span class="character">Aubrey</span> and <span class="character">Cayley Drummle</span> enter
and go up to warm themselves at the fire, which burns
feebly. The time is an evening in March, five years after
the events of Mr. Pinero&rsquo;s play, and <span class="character">Cayley</span> looks
quite five years stouter. <span class="character">Aubrey</span> does not.</p>

<p class="character">Cayley.</p>

<p class="speech">It&rsquo;s quite shocking, Aubrey, that you should have
been married nearly a year, and that I should not yet
have had the pleasure of making Mrs. Tanqueray&rsquo;s
acquaintance. I am dying to know her.</p>

<p class="character">Aubrey.</p>

<p class="pagenum"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span></p>

<p class="speech">My fault, my dear Cayley.</p>

<p class="character">Cayley.</p>

<p class="speech">Entirely. Your weddings are always so furtive.</p>

<p class="direction right">[<span class="direction">Pokes the fire resolutely, in the hope of producing
something approaching a cheerful blaze.</span></p>

<p class="character">Aubrey.</p>

<p class="speech">Well, you&rsquo;ll see her to-night. I hoped she would be
able to dine at home, but she had promised to address
a Temperance meeting in the village. [<span class="direction"><span class="character">Cayley</span> looks
dubious.</span>] However, she&rsquo;ll be back at ten. Meanwhile,
you&rsquo;ll have to be contented with a bachelor dinner.</p>

<p class="direction right">[<span class="direction">They go to the table and sit down.</span></p>

<p class="character">Cayley.</p>

<p class="speech">[<span class="direction">Unfolding serviette.</span>] Experience has taught me, my
dear Aubrey, that bachelor dinners are apt to be
particularly well worth eating. No doubt it is to
make up for the absence of more charming society.</p>

<p class="character">Aubrey.</p>

<p class="speech">[<span class="direction">Doubtfully.</span>] I hope it will prove so in this case.</p>

<p class="character">Cayley.</p>
<p class="pagenum"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span></p>
<p class="speech">I feel sure of it. I remember your cook of old.</p>

<p class="character">Aubrey.</p>

<p class="speech">I&rsquo;m afraid it won&rsquo;t be <em>that</em> cook.</p>

<p class="character">Cayley.</p>

<p class="speech">[<span class="direction">In horror.</span>] You haven&rsquo;t parted with him?</p>

<p class="character">Aubrey.</p>

<p class="speech">Yes. He left soon after my marriage. There was
some small error in his accounts, which Mrs. Tanqueray
discovered. So, of course, we had to dismiss him.</p>

<p class="character">Cayley.</p>

<p class="speech">[<span class="direction">Eagerly.</span>] Do you happen to have his address?</p>

<p class="character">Aubrey.</p>

<p class="speech">I dare say Mrs. Tanqueray has, if you wish to know it.</p>

<p class="direction right">[<span class="direction">Footman hands soup.</span></p>

<p class="character">Cayley.</p>

<p class="speech">I shall be eternally indebted to her.</p>

<p class="character">Aubrey.</p>

<p class="speech">Why?</p>

<p class="character">Cayley.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span></p>

<p class="speech">I shall engage him at once. [<span class="direction">Begins to eat his soup,
frowns, and then puts down his spoon.</span>] But I&rsquo;m afraid
you&rsquo;ll want him back yourself.</p>

<p class="character">Aubrey.</p>

<p class="speech">No. My wife is most particular about the character
of her servants.</p>

<p class="character">Cayley.</p>

<p class="speech">Ah! I&rsquo;m more particular about the character of my
soup.</p>

<p class="direction right">[<span class="direction">His hand goes out instinctively towards his sherry-glass.
As he is about to raise it he sees that it is empty,
and refrains.</span></p>

<p class="character">Aubrey.</p>

<p class="speech">Cayley, you ought to marry. Then you&rsquo;d realise that
there are more important things in the world than soup.</p>

<p class="character">Cayley.</p>

<p class="speech">Of course there are, my dear fellow. There&rsquo;s the fish
and the joint.</p>

<p class="direction right">[<span class="direction">Fish of an unattractive kind is handed to him. He
takes some.</span></p>

<p class="pagenum"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span></p>

<p class="character">Cayley.</p>

<p class="speech">You are quite wrong. A simple cut of beef or mutton,
well-cooked, is quite enough for me.</p>

<p class="character">Butler.</p>

<p class="speech">[<span class="direction">To <span class="character">Cayley</span>.</span>] Lemonade, Sir?</p>

<p class="character">Cayley.</p>

<p class="speech">Eh, what? No, thank you.</p>

<p class="character">Aubrey.</p>

<p class="speech">Ah, Cayley. What will you drink? [<span class="direction"><span class="character">Cayley&rsquo;s</span> face
brightens visibly.</span>] I&rsquo;m afraid I can&rsquo;t offer you any wine.
[<span class="direction">It falls again.</span>] My wife never allows alcohol at her
table. But there are various sorts of mineral waters.
You don&rsquo;t mind?</p>

<p class="character">Cayley.</p>

<p class="speech">[<span class="direction">Grimly.</span>] Not at all, my dear fellow, not at all.
Which brand of mineral water do you consider most&mdash;ah&mdash;stimulating?</p>

<p class="character">Aubrey.</p>

<p class="speech">[<span class="direction">Laughing mirthlessly.</span>] I&rsquo;m afraid, Cayley, you&rsquo;re not
a convert to Temperance principles yet. That shows
you have never heard my wife speak.</p>

<p class="character">Cayley.</p>

<p class="speech">[<span class="direction">Emphatically.</span>] Never! Temperance meetings are
not in my line.</p>

<p class="direction right">[<span class="direction">Footman removes his plate.</span></p>

<p class="character">Aubrey.</p>

<p class="speech">Perhaps some of the other movements in which she is
interested would appeal to you more. [<span class="direction">With a touch of
happy pride.</span>] As you may know, my wife is a vice-president
of the Anti-Vaccination Society, and of the Woman&rsquo;s
Home Rule Union. Indeed, she is in great request on
all public platforms.</p>

<p class="character">Cayley.</p>

<p class="speech">[<span class="direction">With simulated enthusiasm.</span>] I feel sure of that, my
dear Aubrey. [<span class="direction">Footman hands <span class="character">Cayley</span> some rice-pudding.
<span class="character">Cayley</span> puts up his eye-glass, and eyes it curiously.</span>] What is
this?</p>

<p class="character">Footman.</p>

<p class="speech">Rice-pudding, Sir.</p>

<p class="speech">[<span class="direction">Politely.</span>] You&rsquo;re eating nothing, Cayley.</p>

<p class="character">Cayley.</p>

<p class="speech">[<span class="direction">With some concern.</span>] Aubrey, have I <em>slept</em> through the
joint? I have no recollection of eating it. If, in a
moment of abstraction, I refused it, may I change my
mind?</p>

<p class="character">Aubrey.</p>

<p class="speech">[<span class="direction">Sternly.</span>] My wife never has <em>meat</em> at her table on
Fridays.</p>

<p class="character">Cayley.</p>

<p class="speech">[<span class="direction">Peevishly.</span>] My dear fellow, I wish you&rsquo;d thought
of mentioning it before I came down. Then I might
have had a more substantial luncheon. Where&rsquo;s that
rice-pudding?</p>

<p class="direction right">[<span class="direction">Helps himself. There is a rather constrained silence.</span></p>

<p class="character">Aubrey.</p>

<p class="speech">It&rsquo;s really very good of you to have come down to see
us, Cayley.</p>

<p class="character">Cayley.</p>

<p class="speech">[<span class="direction">Pulling himself together.</span>] Very good of you to say so,
my dear chap.</p>

<p class="direction right">[<span class="direction">Tackles his rice-pudding manfully.</span></p>

<p class="character">Aubrey.</p>

<p class="speech">My wife and I can so seldom get any man to drop in
to dinner nowadays.</p>

<p class="character">Cayley.</p>

<p class="speech">[<span class="direction">Giving up his struggle with rice-pudding in despair.</span>] I
suppose so.</p>

<p class="character">Aubrey.</p>

<p class="speech">In fact, we see very little society now.</p>

<p class="pagenum"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span></p>

<p class="character">Cayley.</p>

<p class="speech">[<span class="direction">Sententiously.</span>] Society only likes people who feed it,
my dear Aubrey. You ought to have kept that cook.</p>

<p class="character">Aubrey.</p>

<p class="speech">[<span class="direction">Meditatively.</span>] So my daughter said.</p>

<p class="character">Cayley.</p>

<p class="speech">Ellean? Is she with you now?</p>

<p class="character">Aubrey.</p>

<p class="speech">No. She is in Ireland. After making that remark
she went back to her convent.</p>

<p class="character">Cayley.</p>

<p class="speech">[<span class="direction">Heartily.</span>] Sensible girl! I like Ellean.</p>

<p class="character">Aubrey.</p>

<p class="speech">She and my wife did not get on, somehow. It was
very unfortunate, as it was mainly on Ellean&rsquo;s account
that I thought it right to marry again.</p>

<p class="character">Cayley.</p>

<p class="speech">[<span class="direction">With polite incredulity.</span>] Indeed?</p>

<p class="character">Aubrey.</p>

<p class="pagenum"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span></p>

<p class="speech">Yes. You see, it is so difficult for a girl of Ellean&rsquo;s
retiring disposition to meet people and make friends
when she has no mother to chaperon her. And if she
meets no one, how is she to get married? Dessert,
Cayley?</p>

<p class="character">Cayley.</p>

<p class="speech">[<span class="direction">After surveying a rather unattractive assortment of apples
and walnuts.</span>] No, thanks. As you were saying&mdash;&mdash;?</p>

<p class="character">Aubrey.</p>

<p class="speech">So I thought if I could meet with a really suitable
person, someone with whom she would be in sympathy,
someone she would look upon as a sort of second
mother&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="character">Cayley.</p>

<p class="speech">[<span class="direction">Correcting him.</span>] Third, Aubrey.</p>

<p class="character">Aubrey.</p>

<p class="speech">[<span class="direction">Ignoring the interruption</span>] &mdash;&mdash;it would make home more
comfortable for her.</p>

<p class="character">Cayley.</p>

<p class="speech">[<span class="direction">Laughing.</span>] I like your idea of <em>comfort</em>, Aubrey! But
I should have thought you could have adopted some less
extreme measure for providing Ellean with a chaperon?
You have neighbours. Mrs. Cortelyon, for instance?</p>

<p class="character">Aubrey.</p>

<p class="speech">[<span class="direction">Stiffly.</span>] Mrs. Cortelyon&rsquo;s chaperonage was not very
successful on the last occasion.</p>

<p class="pagenum"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span></p>

<p class="character">Cayley.</p>

<p class="speech">No, no; to be sure. Young Ardale. I was forgetting.</p>

<p class="character">Aubrey.</p>

<p class="speech">Unhappily the whole scheme was a failure. Ellean
conceived a violent aversion for Mrs. Tanqueray almost
directly we came home, and a week later&mdash;I remember
it was directly after dinner&mdash;she announced her intention
of leaving the house for ever.</p>

<p class="character">Cayley.</p>

<p class="speech">[<span class="direction">The thought of his dinner still rankling.</span>] Poor girl! No
doubt she&rsquo;s happier in her convent.</p>

<p class="direction right">[<span class="direction">Butler enters with coffee. <span class="character">Cayley</span> takes some.</span></p>

<p class="character">Aubrey.</p>

<p class="speech">I am sorry I can&rsquo;t ask you to smoke, Cayley, but my
wife has a particular objection to tobacco. She is a
member of the Anti-tobacco League, and often speaks
at its meetings.</p>

<p class="character">Cayley.</p>

<p class="speech">[<span class="direction">Annoyed.</span>] Really, my dear fellow, if I may neither
eat, drink, nor smoke, I don&rsquo;t quite see why you asked
me down.</p>

<p class="character">Aubrey.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span></p>

<p class="speech">[<span class="direction">Penitently.</span>] I suppose I ought to have thought of
that. The fact is, I have got so used to these little
deprivations that now I hardly notice them. Of course,
it&rsquo;s different with you.</p>

<p class="character">Cayley.</p>

<p class="speech">[<span class="direction">Relenting.</span>] If you <em>very</em> much want to smoke, I dare

<p class="speech">Certainly. What is it like?</p>

<p class="character">Cayley.</p>

<p class="speech">I&rsquo;ve no idea. It&rsquo;s an ordinary sort of coat. Your man

<h2><a name="The_Lady_from_the_Sea" id="The_Lady_from_the_Sea"></a>The Lady from the Sea.</h2>

<p class="intro">When Ibsen ended &ldquo;The Lady from the Sea&rdquo; by making Mrs.
Wangel give up her idea of eloping with &ldquo;The Stranger&rdquo; and
decide to remain with her husband and her step-children, many
people must have felt that there was a want of finality about
the arrangement. Having discussed so exhaustively with Dr.
Wangel the advisability of leaving him, she could hardly be
expected to give up the project permanently. The play is
therefore one which emphatically calls for a sequel.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<h3>THE LADY ON THE SEA.</h3>

<p class="scene"><span class="smcap">Scene I.</span>&mdash;Beside the pond in the <span class="character">Wangels&rsquo;</span> garden. It is
a malarious evening in September. <span class="character">Hilda</span> and <span class="character">Boletta</span>,
<span class="character">Mrs. Wangel&rsquo;s</span> step-daughters, are, as usual, failing to
catch the carp which are said to haunt the pond.</p>

<p class="character">Boletta.</p>

<p class="speech">Do you think <em>she</em> [<span class="direction">nodding towards <span class="character">Mrs. Wangel</span>, who
prowls to and fro on the damp lawn with a shawl over her
head</span>] is any better?</p>

<p class="character">Hilda.</p>

<p class="speech">No, worse.</p>

<p class="character">Boletta.</p>

<p class="speech">[<span class="direction">Cheerfully.</span>] Oh, she can&rsquo;t be worse.</p>
<p class="pagenum"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span></p>
<p class="character">Hilda.</p>

<p class="speech">That&rsquo;s all very well for you. You&rsquo;re going to be
married. It doesn&rsquo;t matter to you <em>how</em> mad she is!
You&rsquo;ll be out of it before long.</p>

<p class="character">Boletta.</p>

<p class="speech">[<span class="direction">Jubilantly.</span>] Yes, I shall be out of it.</p>

<p class="character">Hilda.</p>

<p class="speech">But I shan&rsquo;t. [<span class="direction">Darkly.</span>] However, perhaps she&rsquo;ll go
away soon.</p>

<p class="character">Boletta.</p>

<p class="speech">Papa still thinks of moving to the sea-side then?</p>

<p class="character">Hilda.</p>

<p class="speech">[<span class="direction">Crossly.</span>] Oh, Papa&mdash;Papa never thinks!</p>

<p class="character">Boletta.</p>

<p class="speech">Hush, Hilda. What dreadful things you say!</p>

<p class="character">Hilda.</p>

<p class="speech">[<span class="direction">Grimly.</span>] Not half so dreadful as the things I should
like to do.</p>

<p class="character">Boletta.</p>

<p class="speech">Hilda!</p>

<p class="character">Hilda.</p>
<p class="pagenum"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span></p>
<p class="speech">Oh, yes, I should. And I <em>will</em> when I grow up. I&rsquo;ll
make Master-builder Solnes tumble off one of his own
steeples. Think of that now!</p>

<p class="character">Boletta.</p>

<p class="speech">What a horrid child you are! And just when I
thought you were beginning to get on better with <em>her</em> too!
[<span class="direction">Nodding toward <span class="character">Mrs. Wangel</span>.</span>] It&rsquo;s most provoking.</p>

<p class="character">Hilda.</p>

<p class="speech">I call it perfectly thrilling, myself. But here she
comes. [<span class="direction"><span class="character">Mrs. Wangel</span> approaches.</span>] Go away. I want
to talk to her. [<span class="direction">Exit <span class="character">Boletta</span> doubtfully.</span>] How are you
to-day, Mother?</p>

<p class="character">Mrs. Wangel.</p>

<p class="speech">[<span class="direction">Absently.</span>] Eh?</p>

<p class="character">Hilda.</p>

<p class="speech">[<span class="direction">Controlling her impatience.</span>] I asked how you were.</p>

<p class="character">Mrs. Wangel.</p>

<p class="speech">But you called me mother. I&rsquo;m not your mother.
I&rsquo;m only your step-mother.</p>

<p class="character">Hilda.</p>

<p class="speech">But I can&rsquo;t address you as step-mother. &ldquo;People
don&rsquo;t do those things,&rdquo; as dear Hedda Gabler always
says.</p>

<p class="character">Mrs. Wangel.</p>

<p class="speech">[<span class="direction">Whose attention is clearly wand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>ering.</span>] I suppose they
don&rsquo;t.</p>

<p class="character">Hilda.</p>

<p class="speech">Mother, have you seen <em>him</em>?</p>

<p class="character">Mrs. Wangel.</p>

<p class="speech">I believe Wangel is in the surgery.</p>

<p class="character">Hilda.</p>

<p class="speech">I don&rsquo;t mean Papa. What does it matter where Papa
is! I mean The Stranger. The English steamer is at
the pier. It arrived last night. [<span class="direction">Looks at <span class="character">Mrs. Wangel</span>
meaningly.</span>]</p>

<p class="character">Mrs. Wangel.</p>

<p class="speech">[<span class="direction">Vaguely.</span>] Is it, dear? You astonish me.</p>

<p class="character">Hilda.</p>

<p class="speech">You will go and see him, won&rsquo;t you?</p>

<p class="character">Mrs. Wangel.</p>

<p class="speech">Oh, of course, of course.</p>

<p class="character">Hilda.</p>

<p class="speech">I think it must be so perfectly thrilling to go down all
by one&rsquo;s self to a steamer to see a strange man who is
not one&rsquo;s husband.</p>
<p class="pagenum"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span></p>
<p class="character">Mrs. Wangel.</p>

<p class="speech">[<span class="direction">Recalling with difficulty her old phrase.</span>] Oh, yes&mdash;yes.
It allures me wonderfully.</p>

<p class="character">Hilda.</p>

<p class="speech">I should go at once, if I were you, before Papa comes
out.</p>

<p class="character">Mrs. Wangel.</p>

<p class="speech">Don&rsquo;t you think I ought to tell Wangel? I have
always been accustomed to consult him before eloping
with anyone else.</p>

<p class="character">Hilda.</p>

<p class="speech">I think not. You must go of your own free will. You
see, Papa might <em>urge</em> you to go. And then it would not
be altogether your own will that sent you, would it? It
would be partly his.</p>

<p class="character">Mrs. Wangel.</p>

<p class="speech">So it would.</p>

<p class="character">Hilda.</p>

<p class="speech">Isn&rsquo;t it splendid to think of your going away with him
to-night, quite, quite away, across the sea?</p>

<p class="character">Mrs. Wangel.</p>

<p class="speech">[<span class="direction">Doubtfully.</span>] Yes.</p>
<p class="pagenum"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span></p>
<p class="character">Hilda.</p>

<p class="speech">You know you always like the sea. You talk so much
about it. It <em>allures</em> you, you know.</p>

<p class="character">Mrs. Wangel.</p>

<p class="speech">Yes, the idea of it is wonderfully alluring. [<span class="direction">With
misgiving.</span>] But I&rsquo;ve never been <em>on</em> the sea.</p>

<p class="character">Hilda.</p>

<p class="speech">[<span class="direction">Enthusiastically.</span>] That&rsquo;s what makes the idea so
thrilling. It will be quite a new sensation! The sea is
so fresh and buoyant, you know! So <em>rough</em>! Not like
these vapid fiords where it&rsquo;s always calm. Quite different
altogether.</p>

<p class="speech">[<span class="direction">Taking up the cue at once.</span>] Ah, the sea, the wonderful,
changeful sea! So fresh and buoyant, you know! So
rough! Not like these vapid fiords. I had a child
whose eyes were like the sea.</p>

<p class="character">Dr. Wangel.</p>

<p class="speech">[<span class="direction">Testily.</span>] I assure you, Ellida, you are wrong. The
child&rsquo;s eyes were just like other children&rsquo;s eyes. All
children&rsquo;s eyes are. [<span class="direction"><span class="character">Hilda</span> suppresses a slight giggle.

<p class="character">Hilda.</p>

<p class="character">Dr. Wangel.</p>

<p class="speech">[<span class="direction">With interest.</span>] What bait do you use?</p>

<p class="character">Hilda.</p>

<p class="speech">Oh, I have been very careful about the <em>bait</em>. My fish
rose to it at once.</p>

<p class="character">Dr. Wangel.</p>

<p class="character">Hilda.</p>

<p class="speech">I wouldn&rsquo;t mind about that if I were you. I&rsquo;d go
down to the ship just as I was, slip on board without

<p class="character">Mrs. Wangel.</p>

<p class="character">Hilda.</p>

<p class="speech">Of course you will. It&rsquo;s your native element, you

half an hour you&rsquo;ll wish you were overboard, you&rsquo;ll like
the sea so!</p>

a recent bereavement. Her face is as attractive as a liberal
use of cosmetics can make it, and her whole appearance is
that of a middle-aged and rather dissipated member of the
corps de ballet who has gone into half-mourning because
the manager has reduced her salary. <span class="character">Charmian</span>, a
pretty, shrewish-looking damsel, is in attendance on her.</p>

<p class="speech">[<span class="direction">Nervously.</span>] Am I looking my best, Charmian?</p>

<p class="character">Charmian.</p>

<p class="speech">[<span class="direction">Sulkily.</span>] Your majesty is looking as well as <em>I</em> can
make you. If you are not satisfied you had better get
another maid.</p>

<p class="character">Cleopatra.</p>

<p class="speech">[<span class="direction">Looking at herself in hand mirror.</span>] Silly child! Of
course I am satisfied. I think you are wonderful.</p>

<p class="character">Charmian.</p>

<p class="speech">[<span class="direction">Mollified.</span>] Yes. I think I&rsquo;ve not done so badly.</p>

<p class="character">Cleopatra.</p>

<p class="speech">Of course, with Antony not even buried yet, it would
hardly have done for me to be <em>too</em> magnificent.</p>

<p class="character">Charmian.</p>

<p class="speech">[<span class="direction">Decidedly</span>]. Most unsuitable.</p>

<p class="character">Cleopatra.</p>

<p class="speech">As it is, I think we&rsquo;ve arrived at a rather successful
blend of splendour and sorrow, suggesting at once the
afflicted widow and the queen who is open to consolation.</p>

<p class="character">Charmian.</p>

<p class="speech">That is certainly the impression we intended to
convey. By the way, when does Cæsar arrive?</p>

<p class="speech">Octavian? Almost at once.</p>

<p class="character">Charmian.</p>

<p class="speech">His first visit, isn&rsquo;t it?</p>

<p class="character">Cleopatra.</p>

<p class="speech">Yes. So much depends on a first impression. [<span class="direction">Looks

<p class="character">Charmian.</p>

<p class="speech">[<span class="direction">Dubiously.</span>] He&rsquo;s not very impressionable, I hear.</p>

<p class="character">Cleopatra.</p>

<p class="speech">No. But I shall manage it. Think how completely
I fascinated Julius.</p>

<p class="character">Charmian.</p>

<p class="speech">His uncle? I&rsquo;m afraid that&rsquo;s hardly a reason why
you should prove equally attractive to the nephew.</p>

<p class="character">Cleopatra.</p>

<p class="speech">My dear child, why not?</p>

<p class="character">Charmian.</p>

<p class="speech">Well&mdash;the lapse of time, you know. That was
seventeen years ago.</p>

<p class="character">Cleopatra.</p>

<p class="speech">My good Charmian, how crudely you put things.
I declare I&rsquo;ve a good mind to have you executed.</p>

<p class="character">Charmian.</p>

<p class="speech">[<span class="direction">Tranquilly.</span>] Your majesty will hardly do that. I am
the only person in Egypt who really understands the
secret of your majesty&rsquo;s complexion.</p>

<p class="character">Cleopatra.</p>

<p class="speech">That&rsquo;s true. But you ought to be more tactful.</p>

<p class="speech">I wish you wouldn&rsquo;t vex me in this way just when it&rsquo;s
so important that I should look my best. You know
how unbecoming temper is to a woman when she is ...

<p class="character">Charmian.</p>

<p class="speech">There, there! I&rsquo;m sorry I said anything to hurt you.
Don&rsquo;t cry, for Heaven&rsquo;s sake, or that rouge will run.
Then I shall have to go all over you again. Dry

<p class="intro">A DRAMATIC PROLOGUE.</p>
<p class="pagenum"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span></p>

<p class="intro">Those persons who have seen Mrs. Patrick Campbell&rsquo;s magnificent
performance in &ldquo;The Notorious Mrs. Ebbsmith&rdquo; will
have probably gone away with a quite false impression of the
gentleman with whom Agnes Ebbsmith spent her eight years of
married life. &ldquo;For the first twelve months,&rdquo; she declares
bitterly in the first act, &ldquo;he treated me like a woman in a harem,
for the rest of the time like a beast of burden.&rdquo; This is not
quite just to poor Ebbsmith, who was a good sort of fellow in
his commonplace way, and it is manifestly unfair that the
audience should have no opportunity of hearing his side of the
question. An attempt is made to remedy this injustice in the
following Prologue, which all fair-minded persons are entreated
to read before seeing Mr. Pinero&rsquo;s very clever play.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<h3>THE UNFORTUNATE MR. EBBSMITH.</h3>

<p class="scene"><span class="smcap">Scene.</span>&mdash;The dining-room of the <span class="character">Ebbsmiths</span>&rsquo; house in West
Kensington. <span class="character">Agnes</span> and her husband are at breakfast.
They have been married seven years. She looks much as
we see her in the early acts of the play&mdash;gaunt, pale, badly
dressed. He is a careworn man with hair slightly grey at
the temples, an anxious forehead and sad eyes. He is glancing
through the &ldquo;Standard&rdquo; in the intervals of eating his
bacon. She is absorbed in the &ldquo;Morning Screamer,&rdquo; one
of the more violent Socialist-Radical organs of that day.
Presently Ebbsmith looks up.</p>

<p class="character">Ebbsmith.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span></p>

<p class="speech">You won&rsquo;t forget, Agnes, that we are expecting people
to dinner to-night?</p>

<p class="character">Agnes.</p>

<p class="speech">[<span class="direction">Putting down her paper with an air of patient endurance.</span>]
Eh?</p>

<p class="character">Ebbsmith.</p>

<p class="speech">[<span class="direction">Mildly.</span>] I was saying, dear, if you will give me your
attention for a moment, that I hoped you would not
forget that Sir Myles Jawkins and his wife and the
Spencers and the Thorntons were dining here to-night.</p>

<p class="character">Agnes.</p>

<p class="speech">[<span class="direction">Contemptuously.</span>] You seem very anxious that I should
remember that <em>Lady</em> Jawkins is honouring us with her
company!</p>

<p class="character">Ebbsmith.</p>

<p class="speech">I only meant that I hoped you had told Jane about
dinner. Last time the Jawkinses came you may recollect
that you had omitted to order anything for them to eat,
and when they arrived there was nothing in the house
but some soup, a little cold mutton and a rice-pudding.</p>

<p class="character">Agnes.</p>

<p class="speech">Very well [<span class="direction">returns to her paper.</span>]</p>

<p class="pagenum"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span></p>

<p class="character">Ebbsmith.</p>

<p class="speech">Thank you. And, Agnes, if you could manage to be
dressed in time to receive them I should be very much
obliged.</p>

<p class="character">Agnes.</p>

<p class="speech">I?</p>

<p class="character">Ebbsmith.</p>

<p class="speech">Of course. I suppose you will be here to entertain
our guests?</p>

<p class="character">Agnes.</p>

<p class="speech"><em>Your</em> guests, you mean.</p>

<p class="character">Ebbsmith.</p>

<p class="speech">My dear Agnes, surely my guests are your guests
also.</p>

<p class="character">Agnes.</p>

<p class="speech">[<span class="direction">Breaking out.</span>] As long as the present unjust and
oppressive marriage laws remain in force&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="character">Ebbsmith.</p>

<p class="speech">[<span class="direction">Interrupting.</span>] I don&rsquo;t think we need go into the
question of the alteration of the marriage laws.</p>

<p class="character">Agnes.</p>

<p class="speech">Ah, yes. You always refuse to listen to my arguments
on that subject. You know they are unanswerable.</p>

<p class="character">Ebbsmith.</p>

<p class="speech">[<span class="direction">Patiently.</span>] I only meant that there would hardly be
time to discuss the matter at breakfast.</p>

<p class="character">Agnes.</p>

<p class="speech">[<span class="direction">Vehemently.</span>] A paltry evasion!</p>

<p class="character">Ebbsmith.</p>

<p class="speech">Still, I assume that you will be here to receive our
guests&mdash;my guests if you prefer it&mdash;to-night?</p>

<p class="character">Agnes.</p>

<p class="speech">Do you make a point of always being at home to
receive <em>my</em> guests?</p>

<p class="character">Ebbsmith.</p>

<p class="speech">Those Anarchist people whom you are constantly
asking to tea? Certainly not.</p>

<p class="character">Agnes.</p>

<p class="speech">[<span class="direction">With triumphant logic.</span>] Then may I ask why
I should be at home to receive the Jawkinses?</p>

<p class="character">Ebbsmith.</p>

<p class="speech">My dear, you surely realise that the cases are hardly
parallel. T<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>he only time I was present at one of your
Revolutionary tea-parties the guests consisted of a Hyde
Park orator who dropped his h&rsquo;s, a cobbler who had
turned Socialist by way of increasing his importance
in the eyes of the community, three ladies who were
either living apart from their husbands or living with the
husbands of other ladies, and a Polish refugee who had
been convicted, quite justly, of murder. You cannot
pretend to compare the Jawkinses with such people.</p>

<p class="character">Agnes.</p>

<p class="speech">Indeed, I can. [<span class="direction">Rhetorically.</span>] In a properly organized
Society&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="character">Ebbsmith.</p>

<p class="speech">[<span class="direction">Testily.</span>] I really can&rsquo;t stop to re-organize Society
now. I am due at my chambers in half-an-hour.</p>

<p class="character">Agnes.</p>

<p class="speech">[<span class="direction">Sullenly.</span>] As you decline to listen to what I have to
say, I may as well tell you at once that I shall <em>not</em> be at
home to dinner to-night.</p>

<p class="character">Ebbsmith.</p>

<p class="speech">[<span class="direction">Controlling his temper with an effort.</span>] May I ask your
reason?</p>

<p class="character">Agnes.</p>

an important Public question because <em>you</em> have asked a

<p class="speech">&ldquo;As soon as the doors were opened the place of

a compact body of roughs assembled from the neighbouring
streets, and there seemed every prospect of
disorderly scenes. The appearance of Mrs. Ebbsmith
on the platform was greeted with cheers and cries of
&lsquo;Mad Agnes!&rsquo;&rdquo; Surely, my dear, you must recognise
that my professional reputation is endangered when my

<p class="speech">Obscure paragraph! My dear Agnes, the <i>Standard</i>
has a leading article on it. Listen to this:&mdash;&ldquo;Mrs.
Ebbsmith&rsquo;s crusade against the institution of marriage
is again attracting unfavourable attention. Last night
in St. Luke&rsquo;s she once more attempted to ventilate her
preposterous schemes ... crack-brained crusade ...
bellowing revolutionary nonsense on obscure platforms....
This absurd visionary, whom her audiences
not inappropriately nickname &lsquo;Mad Agnes&rsquo;....
Ultimately the meeting had to be broken up by the
police.... We cannot understand how a man in Mr.
Ebbsmith&rsquo;s position can allow himself to be made
ridiculous.&rdquo; [<span class="direction">Almost weeping.</span>] I do think they might

<p class="intro">A DRAMATIZED VERSION.</p>

<p class="intro">When it was announced recently in an English Daily Paper
that a drama founded upon Fitzgerald&rsquo;s version of the Rubáiyát
of Omar Khayyám had been compounded in the United States,
and would shortly be seen on the stage, many people may have
wondered how it was done. It was done as follows:&mdash;</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<h3>OMAR AND OH MY.</h3>

<p class="scene"><span class="smcap">Scene.</span>&mdash;Courtyard of the deserted palace of <span class="character">Jamshyd</span>,
canopied by that inverted bowl commonly called the sky.
To right, a tavern&mdash;not deserted. To left, a potter&rsquo;s
house. At back, the grave of <span class="character">Bahrám</span>, whence a sound
of snoring proceeds. A wild ass stamps fitfully upon it.
It is four o&rsquo;clock in the morning, and the &ldquo;false dawn&rdquo;
shows in the sky. In the centre of the stage stand a lion
and a lizard, eyeing each other mistrustfully.</p>

<p class="character">Lion.</p>

them.</p>

<p class="speech">[<span class="direction">Sarcastically.</span>] <em>Do</em> you? Then I venture to differ
from you.</p>

<p class="character">Lizard.</p>

<p class="speech">Perhaps you&rsquo;d rather we took turns?</p>

<p class="speech">Oh, no, I wouldn&rsquo;t. I mean to have this job to
myself.</p>

<p class="direction right">[<span class="direction">He and the lizard close in mortal combat. After a
gallant struggle the latter is killed, and the lion
proceeds to eat him. Suddenly a shadowy form
issues from the grave at back of stage.</span></p>

<p class="speech">Many thanks, O Sáki. Here&rsquo;s to you. [<span class="direction">Drains
beaker.</span>] Ugh! don&rsquo;t think much of your liquor. I
wish the moon wouldn&rsquo;t look at me like that. She&rsquo;s
